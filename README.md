# Shelltools

Misc tools for use in command shells.

- conc.sh : A bash profile include for [managed concurrency in the bash shell](http://galvanist.com/post/51134915590/managed-concurrency-in-the-bash-shell).
- collect.sh: A bash profile include for creating a new directory and moving things into it, a little like OS X's "new folder with selection" finder operation.
- duhsort.py: A python utility for sorting the output of the command `du -h`. Useful if your sort command doesn't support the `-h` flag.
